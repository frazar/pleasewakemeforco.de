What makes you hungry?

No, I'm not talking about food.

What makes you _hungry_.

Have you haver taken a 12-hour flight? If not, the experience goes a little bit like this. You're sitting in an uncomfortable position, with your leg space shrunk to the minimum the airline could get. Often, someone loud is seated in the row right behind you. One might attempt to find some solace in the media tablet embedded in the seat right in front, but that rarely works out. The luckiest thing that can happen to you is to fall asleep, exhausted, and fast-forward to the landing.

Some airlines however, allow you to set a note on the tablet saying "Please wake me for food". That is convenient if you're hungry enough that you want to interrupt that blissful nap that you're taking. But what could make you _that_ hungry?

For me that's code.

Pretty code, ugly code. Working code, buggy code. You name it.
